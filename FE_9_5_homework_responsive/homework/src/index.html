        <h1 class="main-block__title">The dark side of the moon is a myth.</h1>
        <p class="main-block__text">In realyty both side of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face f the Moon is ever seen fro Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facingthe Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>

        <h1 class="main-block__title">The rise and fall of the tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.</h1>
        <p class="main-block__text">There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon, The bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.</p>

        <h1 class="main-block__title">The Moon is drifting away from the Earth.</h1>
        <p class="main-block__text">The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.</p>

        <h1 class="main-block__title">A person would weigh much less on the Moon.</h1>
        <p class="main-block__text">The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight onEarth. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound so high in the air.</p>

        <p class="main-block__text">This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds, and has huge temperaturevariations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on the Moon, and the sky always appears black.</p>

        <h1 class="main-block__title">The Moon has quakes.</h1>
        <p class="main-block__text">These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seismographs on their visits to the Moon, and foundthatsmall moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten core, just likeEarth.</p>
